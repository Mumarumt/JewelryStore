              REASONS FOR A VALUATION

              <p className="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              Having your jewellery independently valued is important for your
                own protection â€“ <br />
                you are taking a risk by not having it valued. Here are three
                key reasons:

              <p className="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              Many valuations are for insurance purposes with most insurers
                insisting on an update every two to four years.<br/>  Your insurance company may refuse to compensate you for the full
                value of your precious jewellery and<br />gemstones if they have not
                been professionally assessed.A claim for lost or stolen
                jewellery <br /> is far more likely to be favourably processed if you
                have a current valuation certificate.
